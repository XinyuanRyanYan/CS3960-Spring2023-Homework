# Algorithm Fairness in Machine Learning - Homeworks

This repository will contain directories with all homeworks. You can manually download the files for each homework, but we recommend that you use git to clone and update this repository.

You can use GitHub Desktop to update this repository as new homeworks are published, or you can use the following commands:

## Initial Step: Cloning

When you clone a repository you set up a copy on your computer. Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/XinyuanRyanYan/CS3960-Spring2023-Homework.git
```
This will create a folder `CS3960-Spring2023-Homework` on your computer, with the individual homeworks in subdirectories.

Updating
As we release new homeworks, or if we discover mistakes and update an already released homework description, you'll have to update your repository. You can do this by changing into the `CS3960-Spring2023-Homework` directory and executing:

```
git pull
```
That's it - you'll have the latest version of the homeworks.
